## Theme / UI
Inspired by **Chess.com Dark Mode**, adapted with navy and cream tones:

| Element          | Color / Value            |
|-----------------|-------------------------|
| Page background | `#312e2b`              |
| Dark squares    | `#739552`               |
| Light squares   | `#ebecd0`               |
| White pieces    | `#ffffff`               |
| Black pieces    | `#000000`               |
| Move highlight  | yellow, 50% α           |
| Selected square | yellow, 50% α           |
| Capture ring    | translucent black       |
| Check indicator | red, 80% α              |
| Panels & status | `#262421` (dark panel) |
| Buttons         | accent `#81b64c`, secondary `#363431` |

Additional details:
- Fully responsive board — squares and pieces scale for tablets and mobile.  
- Pieces use **text-stroke and drop shadows** for contrast and depth.  
- Promotion modal, move history, and controls match the dark mode aesthetic.

## Architecture
pieces.js ──► rules.js (pure logic, no DOM)
board.js ──► │
▼
game.js (state machine)
│
▼
ui.js (all DOM rendering)
│
main.js (entry point)


- `rules.js` is **stateless and functional** — inputs: board + state; outputs: results only.  
- `game.js` manages the **canonical game state** and exposes an immutable-update API.  
- `ui.js` updates the DOM based on `game.js` state.  
- `main.js` initializes the game on page load.

---

## Extending the Game
- **AI Opponent** — Add `ai.js` using `Rules.getAllLegalMoves(board, 'black', state)` with **minimax + alpha-beta pruning**.  
- **Timers** — Add `clock.js` to count down per-player time, integrated with `Game.executeMove()`.  
- **Persistence** — Save game state to `localStorage` after each move.  
- **Undo/Redo** — Maintain a **state history array** and implement `undo()` / `redo()`.  
- **Move Notation Export** — Export `state.moveHistory` in **PGN format**.
